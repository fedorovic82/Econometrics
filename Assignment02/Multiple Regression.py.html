# # Assignment Multiple regression

# This assignment is of an applied nature and uses data that are available in the data file TestExer2-GPA-round2. The question of interest is whether the study results of students in Economics can be predicted from the scores on entrance tests taken before they start their studies. More precisely, you are asked to investigate whether verbal and mathematical entrance tests predict freshman grades of students in Economics.
# 
# ### A
# 1. Regress FGPA on a constant and SATV. Report the coefficient of SATV and its standard error and p-value (give your answers with 3 decimals).
# 2. Determine a 95% confidence interval (with 3 decimals) for the effect on FGPA of an increase by 1 point in SATV.
# 
# ### B
# Answer questions $a_i$ and $a_2$ also for the regression of FGPA on a constant, SATV, SATM, and FEM.
# 
# ### C
# Determine the (4 Ã— 4) correlation matrix of FGPA, SATV, SATM, and FEM. Use these correlations to explain the differences between the outcomes in parts (A) and (B).
# 
# ### D
# 1. Perform an F-test on the significance (at the 5% level) of the effect of SATV on FGPA, based on the regression in part (b) and another regression. Note: Use the F-test in terms of SSR or $R^2$ and use 6 decimals in your computations. The relevant critical value is 3.9.
# 2. Check numerically that $F = t^2$.
# 
# ### TestExer2-GPA Data
# 
# * Data on student learning of 609 students 
# * FGPA: Freshman grade point average (scale 0-4)
# * SATV: Score on SAT Verbal test (scale 0-10)
# * SATM: Score on SAT Mathematics test (scale 0-10)
# * FEM: Gender dummy (1 for females, 0 for males)

# ### Part C Code

# In[27]:


subset_df = TestExer[["FGPA", "SATV", "SATM", "FEM"]]
subset_df.corr()


# ### Summary Part C
# 
# In general, SATV has significant impact on FGPA when it was the only feature. However, since SATM and SATV are the correlated, the total significance comes from SATM influence. When there was a partial dependence (Case B), we saw that SATV does not have a significant impact.
# Now FEM and SATV do not have a significant correlation so it mut be maintained in the model. The effect of SATM can be absorbed by SATV.

# ### Part D Code
# 
# Suing the results of Part B and inferences of Part C, we can create a new model which looks at only SATM and FEM. We can use that to determine SSR which is defined as the sum of the squared differences between the prediction for each observation and the population. We cab then use the results fo this model to compare against the model_b.

# In[28]:


model_h0 = LinearRegression()
X_h0 = TestExer[["SATM", "FEM"]]
y_h0 = TestExer.FGPA


# In[29]:


model_h0.fit(X_h0, y_h0)
y_pred_h0 = model_h0.predict(X_h0)

SSR_h0_sq = (y_h0 - y_pred_h0)**2
SSR_h0 = SSR_h0_sq.sum()
r_sq_h0 = r2_score(y_h0, y_pred_h0)


# In[30]:


SSR_b_sq = (y - y_pred)**2
SSR_b = SSR_b_sq.sum()
r_sq_b = r2_score(y, y_pred)


# In[31]:


F = (SSR_h0 - SSR_b) / (SSR_b / 605)


# ### Part D Summary

# In[32]:


# Modified Model - SSR and R-squared

# Since the value of the F-statistic is less than the provided critical value, we can safely conclude that the Null hypothesis $H_0$ is not rejected.
