# we can see that there is a decreasing trend between the age and expenditure. As the age decreases, expenditure also decrease. Additionally, we can also see two clusters of data around age groups less than 40 and greater than 40. These clusters will be analyzed further in next questions

# # Answer d
# 
# Splitting the data into the two clusters mentioned in answer b gives opposite inference to what was seen in answer b. There is now an increasing relationship between age and expenditure i.e. as age increases, expenditure also increases. The reason for the overall decreasing trend was because the expenditure of people with age greater than 40 is generally lower than those with age less than 40
# within the two clusters, people with age less than 40 have more sensitive spending habits. The curve for this cluster is steeper compared to the other which indicates that the effect of age on the spending habits is more in age group less than 40 compared to age group greater than 40
